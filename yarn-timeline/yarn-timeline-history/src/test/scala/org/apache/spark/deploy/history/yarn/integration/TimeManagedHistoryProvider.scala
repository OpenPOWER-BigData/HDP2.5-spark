/**
 * A subclass of the history provider which uses the `time` field rather than
 * the current clock. This is needed to reliably test windowed operations
 * and other actions in which the clock is checked.
 *
 * It also stubs the YARN client calls of the [[YarnHistoryProvider]], and doesn't need
 * a YARN cluster connection to work. It also permits tests to alter the list of running apps
 * to simulate failures.
 *
 * @param sparkConf configuration of the provider
 * @param startTime the start time (millis)
 * @param tickInterval amount to increase on a `tick()`
 * @param _livenessChecksEnabled are liveness checks enabled
