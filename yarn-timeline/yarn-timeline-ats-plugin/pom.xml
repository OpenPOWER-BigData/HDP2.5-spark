  This module creates a JAR for deployment inside the YARN ATS server. It's
  standalone so as to be isolated from any spark/scala dependencies.

  It's also excluded from the spark-assembly JAR: it isn't needed there;
  excluding it avoids (future) problems with conflicting versions of the classes
  ever getting into classpaths.

  <description>
    This is a minimal pure-Java JAR which needs to be added to the
    YARN ATS classpath in order for it to successfully process histories
    published to it via the cluster's filesystem â€”that is, the ATS1.5 API.

    It is not intended for incorporation in any assembly JAR, and is only
    used by the yarn-timeline-history module at test time.
